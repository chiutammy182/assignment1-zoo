      Giraffes are the tallest land animals. The average height of a giraffe is
      20 feet. They are a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
      Giraffa. Distinguishing characteristics of giraffes are their long necks
      and spotted coat patterns. Giraffes are very unique since they can stand
      up after half an hour of being born. They can also begin to run after 10
      hours of being born. Additionally, giraffes are one of the mammals that
      requires very little sleep. They only need around ten minutes to two hours
      of sleep.
