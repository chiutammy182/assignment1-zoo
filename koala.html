      The koala is a herbivore native to Australia. As of last year, koalas are
      considered endangered. It is estimated that there are less than 100,000
      koalas remaining in eastern Australia. Because of koalas' low energy diet
      and a great amount of energy needed to break down toxic leaves, koalas
      sleep for 20 hours a day. Additionally, they are considered noctural as
      they are mostly active at night, dawn and dusk. Their life span in the
      wild is around 13 to 18 years. This species also prefers to spend time
      alone.
