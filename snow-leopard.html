    <p>
      Snow leopards live in the mountains of central Asia and the Indian
      subcontinent with elevations of around 6,000 feet during the winter and
      around 18,000 feet in the summer. They are mammals are are in the Panthera
      genus along with lions and tigers. Most snow leopards weight between 60 to
      120 pounds, have a height of two feet, and a length of four to five feet.
      This makes them one of the smaller species of big cats. In their habitat,
      snow leopards are not hunted by other animals, but they are hunted by
      humans which have caused them to become a vunerable species.
