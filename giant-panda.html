    <p>
      The giant panda is a species that is native of China. The average lifespan
      of a giant panda is 20 years in the wild. This species is vunerable of
      extinction with roughly 1,864 giant pandas in their native habitats and
      600 reside in zoos or breeding centers. Giant pandas have lived for
      millions of years in bamboo forests. Because of their thick and wooly coat
      of fur, they are able to stay warm in their habitat. They have inefficient
      digestion so they must consume an abnormally large amount of bamboo; 70
      -100 pounds of bamboo per day.
